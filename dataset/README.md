# Introduction about dataset

This dataset are randomly generated using `gendataset.m` script. 

There are 1750 polynomials where the coefficients are integers chosen in the interval [-10,10], the decision variable x in R^n with n in [2,20], the degree of polynomials d is chosen in the interval [2,6], and the sparsity of polynomials is defined by (spa = number of monomials/dimension of R_d[x]) varying from 0.2 to 1 (the sparse coefficients are generated by MATLAB function `sprand`).  

## Installation
  Download the 7z file and decompress all files into the `dataset` folder.
